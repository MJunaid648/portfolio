# Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my Personal Portfolio! This project is a showcase of my work as a MERN stack developer. The application is built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive design. The portfolio includes links to some of my key projects and features a working contact form that allows visitors to get in touch with me via email.
